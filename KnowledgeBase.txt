That seems a little counterproductive, doesn't it? Isn't the whole point of a Mail Contact to put an external address in your Global Address List? Well, yes and no. There are certain situations where you may not want an external contact to be generally available to your user base. Take this scenario for example. You are the sole IT person at your company. You contract an external company to perform network monitoring 24x7. Your devices email out alerts to a distribution list. This distribution list contains two people. Yourself and the mail contact for the monitoring company. You both get the alerts. They are your safety net when you aren't looking. Their

Right-click on the .ica and select Open with...
